# Song-Lyric-Analysis
Analysis for an article on DataRes' Data Blog, which you can read here: https://ucladatares.medium.com/analyzing-drakes-and-other-rappers-lyrics-b07b3a3d77fc

This doesn't include the code that the other members (Tracy C., Daniel F., and Deana M.) wrote.

These (https://www.kaggle.com/deepshah16/song-lyrics-dataset) were the datasets I used. For each artist, I made word clouds for their lyrics, so I could see what words/topics were talked about the most. I updated the default stopwords to include artist names and profanity (the rappers used profanity the most). After viewing these word clouds, I didn't think they were the most effective way to represent an artist's songs since the words and phrases were not very descriptive. For example, words like "know" or "can" don't tell us much about the song or the artist. So I also used graphed the sentiment counts .
